# Mod 4 SBA Task List
Creating a tasklist that stores information locally.

## Current State

There was a lot of learning going on behind the scenes.  So much Javascript and some filled in gaps in CSS language.  However, I am still trying to make it operational.  I am deliberately
avoiding losing myself in style details until I am confident in making my code work.  But on that day, I am going to style the daylights out of all of it.
